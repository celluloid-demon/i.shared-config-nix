# x-browse.sh - Quickly navigate Xcode project directories.

# Jonathan Dudrey

# This script isn't intended to be run directly - you must source it. I
# suggest setting an alias for it. This script navigates to
# XCODE_DIR/XCODE_PROJECT, where XCODE_PROJECT is the argument.

# By default, this script will simply switch to the Xcode directory.

# Usage: x-browse.sh [project name]

# Set variables
readonly LIB="$HOME/lib"
readonly ULIB="$HOME/usr/lib"
readonly XCODE_DIR="$HOME/Xcode"
readonly XCODE_PROJECT="$1"

# For the purpose of having a tidy command prompt, for now, have XCODE_DIR
# link to the symlink. Later, you can add an option to prefer a sym-linked
# Xcode directory in $HOME, if found, but also include the full Xcode path for
# searching. Hell, you can even make a table for this script to refer to when
# browsing for Xcode projects across multiple Xcode version directories.

# Source libraries
source "$ULIB/stdutils.sh"

# Define functions
main() {
  goto "$XCODE_DIR/$XCODE_PROJECT"
# exec_bash
}

goto() {
  cd "$1/$2"
}

exec_bash() {
  # Start an interactive login shell after changing directories (defunct if the
  # script is sourced as intended)

  echo "Running in child process."
  exec bash --login
}

# Main logic
main
