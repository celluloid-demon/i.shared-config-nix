# WSL-specific helper script to mount/unmount cdrom drive to linux subsystem in
# Windows (only NTFS drives are automounted in WSL).

# Constants
# DRIVE="/dev/cdrom"
DRIVE="E:"

# dumb
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom
sudo mount -t drvfs "$DRIVE" /mnt/cdrom

# slightly less dumb WIP (powershell)
# $CdRom = Get-WmiObject -Class win32_logicaldisk -Filter "DriveType = '5'"
# $CdRom | Select-Object -Property deviceid
# can do something with this?

# get windows volume name of disc drive in powershell
# $CdRom = Get-WmiObject -Class win32_logicaldisk -Filter "DriveType = '5'"
# $CdRomVolumeName = $CdRom.VolumeName

# single line:
# $CdRomVolumeName = (Get-WmiObject -Class win32_logicaldisk -Filter "DriveType = '5'").VolumeName

# in WSL:
# powershell.exe -command "& {(Get-WmiObject -Class win32_logicaldisk -Filter \"DriveType = '5'\").VolumeName}"
