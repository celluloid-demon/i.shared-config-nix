# Proxy rc.d script to set custom umask

# Was tired of having to manually fix permissions to get
# rslsync and emby to both write to the same dataset.

# To install this script, make it executable (755), then
# copy or symlink it to:
# /usr/local/opt/rslsync/bin/

# Then change the command that /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rslsync
# runs so that it points to this script:
# #command="/usr/local/bin/rslsync"
# command="/usr/local/opt/rslsync/bin/rslsync-umask.sh"

# The one quirk is that service(8) will no longer be able
# to tell that rslsync is running - this is an accepted
# limitation.

umask 002
/usr/local/bin/rslsync "$@"
