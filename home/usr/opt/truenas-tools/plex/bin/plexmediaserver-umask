# Proxy rc.d script to set custom umask

# Was tired of having to manually fix permissions to get
# rslsync and emby to both write to the same dataset. This
# solution also works for other processes.

# To install this script, make it executable (755), then
# copy or symlink it to:
# /usr/local/opt/plexmediaserver/bin/

# Then change the command that /usr/local/etc/rc.d/plexmediaserver
# runs so that it points to this script:
# #command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
# command="/usr/local/opt/plexmediaserver/bin/plexmediaserver-umask"

# The one quirk is that service(8) will no longer be able
# to tell that plexmediaserver is running - this is an accepted
# limitation.

# From the umask(2) man page: "Child processes inherit the
# mask of the calling process." This mechanism is what
# allows daemon(8) to pass its mask to the mono child
# process (and thus plexmediaserver) when the -p <child
# process PID filename> option is used.
