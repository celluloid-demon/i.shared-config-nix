# shared-config-nix

Shared configuration for multiple linux-based hosts.

***NOTE: THIS REPO IS DESIGNED TO BE INSTALLED / CLONED INTO A HIDDEN HOME DIRECTORY.***

A suitable location is `$HOME/.shared-config-nix` - that way there is no chance of you accidentally removing it if you need to remove your `$HOME/git` directory for any reason, and the directory itself can remain a source of truth that you can push / pull for updates.
